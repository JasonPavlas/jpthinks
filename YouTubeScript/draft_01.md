# YouTube Script

## Hook
 I just got fired from my last job and in this job market,
 I think it's important to stand out. 

 Resumes are low fidelity means of hiring - Thus, I got back on macbook and started building things again. 

  ### Images to show on screen
  I'm thinking of a talking-headshot of me, but im not sure about the background / scene.

## Premise
 I made this little site that will tell me the weather in Jacksonville, Florida. 

 It's nothing fancy, but it's up and running right now FOR FREE and it only took me like 3 hours to build.
 
 That includs the tangents sprinkled in to learn abit more about some feature or method my 'copilot' sugested.

 Like this site has a React font end - I'v never used React.
 Im more of an Infrastructure guy, but have had enough tech jobs where i've just achived an amature web dev status...lol

 anyways, i think I can show you how to build this thing in about 3 5 minute parts. 
 This will probably take you about an hour to complete, 
 but thats 60 minutes to launch your very own website!

  ### Images to show on screen
  I captured my screen using sngait when I was building the site. I think i'll show small snippets from those videos.

## What I'm going to tell you
The first thing I'm going to show you is where the stuff you'll need is. I have a repo on github.com that has all the code for my instance, 
but more importantly, it has a README.md file which is like your instruction manual for this adventure.

When you go to the readme, you'll see the typical format that'd youd expect to see in a text book and most pro software companies will use some iteration of this format.
It's in a "format" called 'markdown', which you may or may not have ever heard of, 
but it's just a simple way to format text so that it can be converted to HTML.

so 3 parts:
1. Part 1:
we are going to make the website work on your laptop.

2. Part 2:
we are going to create the infrastructure to host the website on Azure. 

3. Part 3:
we are going to create the Continues Deployment pipeline to actually deploy the thing and make it accessible on the internet.

Remember, I'm going to cover these parts in about 5 minutes each, which is NOT going to be enough time for you to follow along step by step. 
So you'll most likey need to pause or backup a few times when you are doing each of these things. 

But if you have a laptop, a credit card, and want to make a free website you can text your freinds a link to in the next hour, 
then this is the video for you. 

Just to be clear, there is NO cost to do this, you only need the credit card to create the free azure account. 
They give you $200 to start with, but the site I'm showing right now is literally free. 

But if you dont have a credit card, you can still get the site up and running on your local machine which is what I want to cover first.
